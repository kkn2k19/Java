/*
Will the following statement give any error in Java?

int $ = 24;
*/

No, the statement int $ = 24; is valid in Java.
In Java, variable names can start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($). Although using $ as a variable name is syntactically correct, 
it's not a common practice and can make the code less readable. It's usually reserved for auto-generated code or other special cases.
For the sake of clarity and maintainability, it's a good practice to give variables meaningful names that describe their purpose or the data they hold.


Yes, the statement int $ = 24; will produce a compilation error in C.
In the C language, variable names cannot start with a dollar sign ($). Variable names in C can only start with a letter (either uppercase or lowercase) or an underscore (_). After the first character, it can have letters, numbers, or underscores.
Thus, using $ as a variable name in C is invalid and will not compile.
